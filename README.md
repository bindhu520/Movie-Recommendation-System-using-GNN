ABSTRACT
	The recommender system is one of the most important information services on todayâ€™s Internet. Recently, graph neural networks have become the new state-of-the-art approach to recommender systems. The background and the history of the development of both recommender systems and graph neural networks. The motivation for applying graph neural networks into recommender systems, mainly consists of the high-order connectivity, the structural property of data, and the enhanced supervision signal. Then systematically analyze the challenges in graph construction, embedding propagation/aggregation, model optimization, and computation efficiency. For a few database has missing values that are treated as non-evaluated items. Recommender systems try to predict the user's evaluation of an item that has not yet been evaluated. Based on the concept that people who are more closely connected have more influence on each other's opinions It will try to predict these missing values based on relations, so as to generate more relevant results.
